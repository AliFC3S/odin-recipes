# odin-recipes
This is my first full HTML project. This will demonstrate my learnings so far with HTML. I will be creating a simple recipe website. The goal of this project is to use my learnings of basic HTML formatting, links and images to create a basic website. This project may be updated as I progress in the odin project.
